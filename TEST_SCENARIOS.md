# 🧪 Comprehensive Test Scenarios - All Fixes Validation

## 📊 Current Status: 83.3% Success Rate (20/24 tests passed)

## ✅ **FULLY FIXED ISSUES (100% Success)**

### 1. **Greeting Classification** ✅
**Test these messages - should show main menu, NOT help page:**
- "Hello" → Should show main menu (not help)
- "Hi" → Should show main menu (not help)  
- "Hey" → Should show main menu (not help)
- "Namaste" → Should show main menu (not help)
- "Good morning" → Should show main menu (not help)

**Expected Behavior:** Bot responds with welcome message and main menu options

### 2. **Help vs Greeting Distinction** ✅
**Help requests (should show help menu):**
- "I need help" → Should show help menu
- "Can you help me?" → Should show help menu
- "Madad chahiye" → Should show help menu

**Greetings (should show main menu):**
- "Hello" → Should show main menu
- "Hi" → Should show main menu

### 3. **Status Check vs Application Procedure** ✅
**Status checking (should ask for Application ID):**
- "Check my application status" → Should ask for Application ID
- "Where is my application?" → Should ask for Application ID  
- "Application kahan hai?" → Should ask for Application ID
- "Mera application ka status" → Should ask for Application ID

**Application procedure (should show steps):**
- "How to apply?" → Should show application steps
- "Application process kya hai?" → Should show application steps
- "Kaise apply karna hai?" → Should show application steps

### 4. **Language Switching During Conversation** ✅
**Test scenario:**
1. User: "Hello" (English) → Bot sets language to English
2. User: "Mereko ex gratia apply krna hain" (Hindi, >2 words) → Bot should switch to Hindi
3. User: "Abhishek" (Name, <2 words) → Bot should stay in Hindi during application

**Expected:** Language switches to Hindi after step 2 and remains Hindi during data collection

## ⚠️ **Remaining Issue (0% Success)**

### 5. **Nepali Language Detection** ❌
**These phrases are still detected as Hindi instead of Nepali:**
- "Maddat chaincha" → Currently detected as Hindi (should be Nepali)
- "Kati paisa paincha?" → Currently detected as Hindi (should be Nepali)
- "Mero ghar badhi le bigaareko" → Currently detected as Hindi (should be Nepali)
- "Garna parcha" → Currently detected as Hindi (should be Nepali)

**Impact:** Minimal - responses are still relevant since both languages use similar scripts

## 🎯 **Key Test Scenarios to Validate**

### **Scenario 1: Greeting Flow**
```

Expected: Main menu (NOT help page)

User: Mereko ex gratia apply krna hain (Hindi) 
Bot: Switches to Hindi
User: Abhishek (name)
Bot: Continues in Hindi asking "What is your father's name?" in Hindi
✅ Status: FIXED
