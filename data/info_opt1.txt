**What is Ex-Gratia Assistance?**

I understand you want to know about ex-gratia assistance. Let me explain this important government support program in simple terms.

Ex-gratia assistance is immediate financial help provided by the Sikkim government to families affected by natural disasters. Think of it as emergency support when nature causes unexpected damage to your home, crops, or livelihood.

**Who qualifies for this assistance?**

You may be eligible if you've suffered losses due to:
- Heavy rainfall, floods, or landslides
- Earthquakes or other natural calamities
- Crop damage from hailstorms or excessive rain
- House damage from natural disasters
- Loss of livestock due to natural causes

**Financial Support Available:**

The compensation ranges from ₹4,000 to ₹25,000 depending on your specific loss:

*House Damage:*
- Partial damage: ₹4,000 - ₹12,000
- Severe damage: ₹15,000 - ₹25,000

*Crop Loss:*
- Per hectare loss: ₹4,000 - ₹8,000
- Complete crop failure: Up to ₹15,000

**Important Timeline:**
You must apply within 30 days of the incident. Don't delay - this deadline is strictly followed.

**Example Scenario:**
"If your house was damaged in last month's heavy rainfall, and you have photos of the damage plus a local authority report, you could receive ₹12,000 to ₹20,000 depending on the extent of damage."
