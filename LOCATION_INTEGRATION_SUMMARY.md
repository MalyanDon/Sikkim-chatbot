## ✅ **Integration Status: SUCCESSFUL**

Your SmartGov bot now has a **working location capture system** that actually captures user coordinates!

## 📍 **What Was Integrated:**

### **1. New Location System**

### **3. Data Storage**
- ✅ **CSV file created**: `data/location_data.csv`
- ✅ **Coordinates captured**: Latitude/Longitude
- ✅ **User information**: User ID, name, timestamp
- ✅ **Interaction tracking**: Service type, message text

## 🧪 **How to Test:**

### **Test Emergency Services:**
1. Open Telegram and find your bot
2. Send: "I need emergency help" or "Need ambulance"
3. Bot will request location with keyboard
4. Click "📍 Share My Location"
5. Allow location permission

2. Bot will request location for nearby services
3. Share location for location-based recommendations

## 📊 **Data Captured:**

The system creates `data/location_data.csv` with:
```csv
timestamp,user_id,user_name,latitude,longitude,interaction_type,message_text
2025-07-25T15:30:00,123456789,John Doe,19.223848,72.987487,emergency,Emergency services requested
